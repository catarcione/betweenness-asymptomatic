**"Identifying Asymptomatic Nodes in Network Epidemics using Betweenness Centrality"**

# Overview
Asymptomatic individuals play a significant role in the spread of epidemics, yet often remain undetected. This work proposes and evaluates methods for **identifying asymptomatic nodes** in network-based epidemic simulations, using only the network topology and a snapshot of observed symptomatic cases.

The key contribution is a modified version of **betweenness centrality**, which considers only the shortest paths between pairs of observed infected nodes, to rank unobserved nodes according to their likelihood of being asymptomatic.
